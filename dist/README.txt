  OVERTAKE TELEMETRY - Plugin for SimHub
  racehub.overtakef1.com
=============================================


  INSTALLATION (First Time)
  -------------------------

  1. Make sure SimHub is installed on your PC
     (download at simhub.gg if you don't have it)

  2. Place BOTH files below in the SAME folder:
     - Install-OvertakeTelemetry.bat
     - Overtake.SimHub.Plugin.dll

  3. Double-click "Install-OvertakeTelemetry.bat"

  4. A window will appear asking to confirm.
     Click YES to install.

  5. Done! Open SimHub and look for
     "Overtake Telemetry" in the left menu.


  CONFIGURATION (Required)
  ------------------------

  After installing, you need to configure:

  STEP 1 - In F1 25 (Game):
    Settings > Telemetry:
    - UDP Telemetry = On
    - UDP IP = 127.0.0.1
    - UDP Port = 20778
    - UDP Format = 2025

  STEP 2 - In SimHub:
    Home > Codemasters F1 25 > Game config...
    - Set UDP Port = 20777

  For CONSOLE (PS5 / Xbox):
    Same as above, but in Step 1 use your
    PC's IP address instead of 127.0.0.1
    (find it by running "ipconfig" on your PC)


  UPDATING THE PLUGIN
  -------------------

  When a new version is available, the plugin
  will show "Update available" inside SimHub.

  To update:
  1. Download the new version from
     racehub.overtakef1.com/downloads
  2. Run the installer again (same process)
     It will replace the old version.


  HOW IT WORKS
  ------------

  The plugin captures F1 25 telemetry data
  during your race sessions and generates a
  JSON file with all results, lap times,
  penalties, and driver stats.

  Upload the JSON at racehub.overtakef1.com
  to get instant standings and statistics
  for your league.

  The plugin relays all data to SimHub so
  your dashboards and overlays keep working
  normally.
